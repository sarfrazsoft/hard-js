a(); // "Hello A"
b(); // TypeError
function a() {
console.log("Hello A");
}
var b = function() {
console.log("Hello B");
}
// Why? During memory creation phase a is created in memory and
// function assigned to a. But b is created like a variable (b: undefined)
// and until code reaches the function() part, it is still undefined. So, it
// cannot be called
